# Drowsiness-Detection-System

DrowsinessDetector: Real-Time Driver Alert System  This project implements a computer vision-based drowsiness detection system to enhance road safety. It utilizes:  Facial Landmark Detection: Tracks key facial features, particularly eyes, to assess drowsiness indicators. Alerting Mechanisms: Triggers alarms (visual, audio) when drowsiness is detected, prompting drivers to rest. This system aims to:  Reduce Driver Fatigue: Address a major cause of road accidents by alerting drivers to their drowsiness. Improve Road Safety: Promote safer driving habits and potentially decrease the number of fatigue-related crashes. 

Potential Applications:  Driver Assistance Systems In-Vehicle Safety Features This project is open to contributions for further development and exploration of advanced drowsiness detection techniques.
